## Kele - Ruby Gem API client.

Bloc's API provides an external facing JSON Web Token authorized gateway to the Bloc application. 
This API client can manage the low-level details of making requests and handling responses. 
We built the Kele API Client to provide easy access to and use of the student endpoints of Bloc's API.
